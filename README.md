**In this project we will build the Model Hierarchical Clustering for clustering Spending Score and make different clusters based on different features in the dataset**.<br></br>  

Hierarchical clustering is a popular method for grouping objects. It creates groups so that objects within a group are similar to each other and different from objects in other groups. Clusters are visually represented in a hierarchical tree called a dendrogram.<br></br>
Hierarchical clustering has a couple of key benefits:<br>

There is no need to pre-specify the number of clusters. Instead, the dendrogram can be cut at the appropriate level to obtain the desired number of clusters.
Data is easily summarized/organized into a hierarchy using dendrograms. Dendrograms make it easy to examine and interpret clusters.<br></br>




**Important- Note: Explore the dataset once before going through the code.**
