**In this project we will build the Model Hierarchical Clustering for clustering Spending Score and making different clusters based on different features in the dataset**.<br></br>  

Random Forest is one of the most popular and commonly used algorithms by Data Scientists. Random forest is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems. It builds decision trees on different samples and takes their majority vote for classification and average in case of regression.<br></br>
Random forest is a versatile machine learning algorithm developed by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler. It leverages an ensemble of multiple decision trees to generate predictions or classifications. By combining the outputs of these trees, the random forest algorithm delivers a consolidated and more accurate result.<br></br>
Its widespread popularity stems from its user-friendly nature and adaptability, enabling it to tackle both classification and regression problems effectively. The algorithm’s strength lies in its ability to handle complex datasets and mitigate overfitting,  making it a valuable tool for various predictive tasks in machine learning.<br></br>
One of the most important features of the Random Forest Algorithm is that it can handle the data set containing continuous variables, as in the case of regression, and categorical variables, as in the case of classification. It performs better for classification and regression tasks. 


**Important- Note: Explore the dataset once before going through the code.**
